In this scenario, most Indian travellers typically do not require a visa, as they will not cross the external Schengen border.  Please note that if you arrive at Oslo airport for transit purposes, the transit area is closed between 11 p.m. and 6 a.m. If your arrival and your connecting flight\'s departure time necessitate staying at the airport between 11 p.m. and 6 a.m., you won\'t be able to use the transit area during this period. Instead, all travellers will be required to go through border control to remain in the airport\'s non-transit area or at a nearby hotel. This means that Indian nationals who must have a visa when crossing the external Schengen border, as indicated in Annex 1 of the Visa Handbook, will require a Schengen visa even if they are only transiting through Schengen in Norway. Indian Nationals need to collect and check in their luggage at the airport during a layover (for example, when using different airlines), as they will be required to go through border control.\"},{\"question\":\"Does Norway offer visas on arrival to Indians?\",\"answer\":\"No, Norway does not offer visas on arrival to Indians.

It\'s advisable to confirm the precise dates and duration once your visa is granted.\"},{\"question\":\"What is the processing time for a Norway Tourist Visa?\",\"answer\":\"The processing time for a Norway tourist visa typically ranges from 15 to 21 working days following your appointment at the visa application centre.\"},{\"question\":\"How can I check my Norway visa application status online?\",\"answer\":\"You can Track Your Norway Visa Application Online, you can use the Application reference number and your date of birth.
